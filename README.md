# 🧰 SOHO Network Design & Security Optimization  (Law Firm)

This project showcases the design and implementation of a **Secure SOHO (Small Office Home Office) network** for a law firm, aimed at solving key network challenges including poor speed, disconnection issues, and security vulnerabilities.

### 📌 Project Summary
A local law firm experienced frequent network failures, inefficiencies, and security gaps. Using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, I designed and simulated a robust network infrastructure featuring:

- DHCP for automated IP address management
- Internal DNS to reduce external dependency
- VLAN segmentation for departmental isolation
- Optimized inter-VLAN communication
- Enhanced scalability and traffic control

---

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Cisco Packet Tracer**

---

### 🔍 Features & Implementation
- **DHCP Server** for dynamic IP assignment (192.168.2.1 gateway)
- **DNS Server** to resolve internal domain queries (192.168.2.3)
- **VLANs** for IT, HR, Finance, and Admin departments
- **Managed Switches** for efficient segmentation
- **Inter-VLAN Routing** for secure, high-speed communication
- **Endpoints:** 13 devices (PCs and Laptops) properly configured

---

### 🚀 Improvements Achieved
- Faster & stable network performance
- Reduced IP conflict through DHCP
- Stronger internal security via VLANs
- Minimal external DNS reliance
- Scalable infrastructure for future expansion

---

### 📈 Outcome
A secured, structured SOHO network now powers the law firm with better speed, reduced downtime, and improved cybersecurity.
